   <td style="text-align:left;"> SPX Flow Inc. 
        FLOW,
        +0.18%,
       a provider of process software for the nutrition, health and industrial markets, said Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Lone Star Funds in an all-cash deal valued at about $3.8 billion. The price is equal to a premium of about 40% over SPX Flow's closing price on July 16, the last trading day before a Wall Street Journal report that the company had received an unsolicited bid. Robert Hull, chair of the SPX Flow board, said the company held talks with "multiple strategic and financial parties" to evaluate the deal against the company's standalone prospects, performance and outlook. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, after which the company will be privately held. As part of the deal, SPX Flow has agreed to suspend its quarterly dividend with immediate effect. Shares were slightly higher premarket and have gained 48% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 
        SPX,
        -0.75%

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc. (KBRA) said Monday it agreed to sell a majority stake in the 400-employee company to private equity firm Parthenon Capital LLC for $900 million. KBRA operates five offices in the U.S. and Europe and has issued more than 51,000 ratings with nearly $3 trillion in rated issuance since it launched in 2010. KBRA CEO, president and co-founder Jim Nadler led the deal, along with Parthenon Capital's co-CEO Brian Golson and partner Zach Sadek led the deal., The Fed may speed up tapering, Bank of England might or might not raise rates, and the European Central Bank could hint at what will come after the end of its pandemic program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Steve Gelsi covers banking and cannabis as a Senior Reporter for MarketWatch. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Mexican peso traded just around 20.95 per USD in mid-December, not far from a 3-week high of 20.81 hit on November 19th, as investors took a breath ahead of central bank meetings. The Fed is expected to signal a faster tapering of its asset purchases and an earlier start to rate hikes as the economy stayed robust, with upbeat employment numbers and high inflation. Meanwhile, hotter-than-expected inflation data in Mexico put pressure on the Central Bank to keep its tightening cycle and raise again the rates by 25 bps in its next meeting as inflation is well above its 3% target. In November consumer prices rose 7.37% YoY, above market expectations of a 7.22% increase, and the highest in two decades. Also, Banxico is expected to outline a more hawkish policy stance to 2022 in order to curb inflation expectations and the contagion of this year's high inflation. </td>

Energy stocks fell by 1.5% and health stocks shed 0.9%, with the latter reflecting poor performances by cannabis companies. On the other hand, mining stocks edged higher amid stronger gold prices. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada has agreed with the Canadian government to keep the inflation target unchanged at 2%, as expected, adding it could leave interest rates lower if needed to support employment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar traded around 1.28 in mid-December, near to an 8-month low of 1.284 hit on December 3rd, as investors were cautiously awaiting the 2-day Fed meeting in which the monetary authority is expected to signal a faster tapering of its asset purchases and an earlier start to rate hikes as the economy stayed robust, with upbeat employment numbers and high inflation. Meanwhile, in its last meeting, the BoC said that the new variant Omicron had raised the uncertainty around the economic recovery and maintained its guidance of start rates hike during the middle quarters of 2022, dashing some investors' expectations of a shift for a more hawkish policy stance. Also, the BoC decided to resume the reinvestment phase at roughly the same pace, during which it purchases government bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. Still, the policymakers noted that recent economic indicators suggested the economy had gained considerable momentum in Q4 namely in the labor and housing markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stocks erased early gains to trade near the flat line on Monday, as investors remain cautious ahead of key central bank meetings this week. The ECB, the Bank of England, the US Fed and the Bank of Japan are all due to provide an update on the price outlook and policy guidance for 2022, with policymakers weighing concerns over the Omicron variant against mounting inflationary pressure. The bloc's central bank will debate options on how to adapt the bank's regular asset purchase programme after its PEPP ends in March, while the Fed will likely announce a faster unwinding of pandemic-era stimulus plans. Among single stocks, German software giant SAP gained nearly 3% after UBS upgraded the company to "buy" from "neutral", while Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma jumped 14% after Australian biopharma giant CSL confirmed it was in talks to buy the firm.

It really isn't hurting families, and they're dead wrong. This bill does make it worse in a number of ways. Obviously, spending another $5 trillion heaping that fuel onto the inflation fire won't help, but really, it's the policies within it. They make the labor shortage worse in this bill, which will drive inflation. They do that by no longer requiring earnings or work in the child tax credit, and… they really exploded the subsidies in Obamacare, so much so that between the two policies, experts predict two million fewer workers will be available because of these policies. So here you are, shoveling more money into the economy with fewer workers and supply chain problems anyway, so that means inflation's going to go higher. It's obviously going to last longer. That's all bad. Joe Manchin knows this, and he also knows when the president calls him the president is nearly one million jobs short of his promises from the last COVID stimulus. So why would we believe the promises he makes on this bill? , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Rep.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index reversed early gains to trade slightly lower around 71,430 on Monday afternoon, as investors turned more cautious ahead of the monetary policy decisions from the world's largest central banks amid elevated inflation and uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron virus variant on the global economy. Early in the session, gains were mainly supported by iron ore producers. Domestically, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is fully vaccinated, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, indicating the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant. The national coronavirus command council is expected to map out the way forward this week following the surge in cases in the economic heartland of Gauteng in particular. On the data front, November consumer price inflation and producer price data will be released later in the week. </td>

But Americans said they expect gasoline and medical care to get cheaper over the next year, while they think that rent will remain unchanged.                                                                                                                , The report is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The survey plays a critical role in determining how Fed policymakers respond to the recent inflation spike. That's because actual inflation depends – at least in part – on what consumers think it will be. It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy – if everyone expects prices to rise by 3% in the year, that signals to businesses that they can increase prices by at least 3%. Workers, in turn, will want a 3% pay raise to offset the rising costs., "This is about well-anchored inflation expectations," Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said during a question-and-answer session at the Cleveland Fed two weeks ago. "Getting actual inflation down close to 2% is going to be an important part of keeping those expectations anchored."                                                                                                                                                                  , WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 22: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks as Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell listens during an announcement at the South Court Auditorium of Eisenhower Executive Office Building on November 22, 2021 in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                   , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has already signaled the U.S. central bank may speed up its withdrawal of pandemic support for the U.S. economy in order to combat inflation, which has been higher and longer-lasting than policymakers initially expected. That could mean the Fed's bond-buying program ends sooner than expected, potentially leading to a faster-than-expected interest rate hike.                                                          , "At this point, the economy is very strong, and inflationary pressures are high," Powell said two weeks ago while testifying on Capitol Hill. "It is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner."                                                                                                                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A Labor Department report last week revealed that the price of consumer goods rose by 6.8% in November from last year, the fastest pace since June 1982 – all but solidifying the Fed's plans to accelerate its tapering timeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "[The] consumer price data, with annual inflation reaching a near 40-year high of 6.8%, greatly increase the pressure on the Federal Reserve to wind down its asset purchase program even more quickly than previously communicated and bring interest rate hikes forward to the first half of 2022," said Matthew Sherwood, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. </td>

Also, in its last meeting, the BoC said that the new variant Omicron had raised the uncertainty around the economic recovery and maintained its guidance of start rates hike during the middle quarters of 2022, dashing some investors' expectations of a shift for a more hawkish policy stance. Meanwhile, the central bank decided to resume the reinvestment phase at roughly the same pace, during which it purchases government bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. Still, the policymakers noted that recent economic indicators suggested the economy had gained considerable momentum in Q4 namely in the labor and housing markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lithium carbonate prices in China rallied further to 222,500 yuan per tonne, amid higher demand and fears of supply shortages. Bets on long-term scarcity of the light metal set electric battery manufacturers to race against each other to secure lithium supplies through long-term contracts, as supply-chain bottlenecks and environmental opposition limit lithium production. Meanwhile, demand for electric vehicles continues to grow. China, the world’s top lithium-ion battery importer, is expected to double last year’s electric vehicle deliveries to 3 million units in 2021. Citigroup analysts believe lithium demand shall outpace supply until 2025.

But many economists say the rate cuts are reckless.                                 , Last month, the country's inflation rate hit 21.7%.                                                                                                                                               , The  BBC's Victoria Craig in Istanbul says taxi drivers, food sellers and hotel patrons have all expressed surprise and anger as they see the value of the money in their pockets drop by the day., Normally, central banks raise rates to combat rising prices, but Mr Erdogan has called such tools "the mother and father of all evil".                                                            , Although the bank has attempted to bolster the value of the lira by using its dollar reserves to buy the currency, analysts say it does not have enough firepower to stop the slide.              , "We doubt that either intervention or a balanced current account will be effective in stabilising the currency," said investment bank Morgan Stanley in a note.                                   , It added that the central bank's relatively thin reserves meant interventions could turn out to be counter-productive.                                                                            , What cases will the detective duo take on this time?                                                                                                                                              , Prof. Steven Pinker tries to make sense of the situation...                                                                                                                                       , © 2021 BBC.

The holidays are upon us, and we should be turning our thoughts to friends, family church and temple. Instead, we're being hustled back into our masks, fired if we don't get the jab, attacked on the streets of our big cities. We're even supposed to check the vaccination status of our holiday guests., So for Christmas, I’m going to Florida. I want to be in a more positive environment. I can't escape all risk, but I can be in a place that lets me choose how I want to live. I'm tired of being down frankly.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A French court reduced a fine to UBS Group AG for a case stemming from helping affluent clients to keep undeclared funds in Swiss bank accounts, according to reports from Bloomberg and other news services. UBS will now be charged a 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) fine, down from 4.5 billion euros, according to the Paris court of appeals. The court upheld a 2019 ruling that the bank helped clients avoid taxes. The 1.8 billion euro fine for UBS includes 800 million euros in damages and a confiscation order of 1 billion euros.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Putin rues Soviet collapse, says he moonlit as a taxi driver to survive economic crisis - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago as the demise of what he called "historical Russia," and said the economic crisis that followed was so bad he was forced to moonlight as a taxi driver.                                                                                , Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on Ukraine, a notion the Kremlin has dismissed as fear-mongering.                                          , "It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union," Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called "Russia. New History," the RIA state news agency reported.                                                                                                , "We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost," said Putin, saying 25 million Russian people in newly independent countries suddenly found themselves cut off from Russia, part of what he called "a major humanitarian tragedy."                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation.                                                                                                                                                            , "Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place," the president said.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power.                                                         , Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used a lengthy article published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbor and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kiev as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history., The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January. The Group of Seven wealthy democracies warned Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine.                                                                      , The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories.                                                                                                                         , Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has backed separatists who took control of a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year and who continue to fight Ukrainian government forces.                                                                                                                                                , </td>

       plans to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
        ARNA,
        +83.63%
       in a deal worth $6.7 billion and announced Monday morning. Pfizer's stock was up 1.2% in premarket trading on Monday, while shares of Arena soared 88.3%. "We view PFE as a logical partner for ARNA as the latter continues to progress its gastroenterology, dermatology, and cardiology focused platform, which should benefit from the executional expertise of a large pharmaceutical company," SVB Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz told analysts in a research note. "PFE's commercial framework can capitalize on etrasimod's best-in-class potential," wrote RBC Capital Markets' Kennen MacKay. The one thing that surprised Wall Street was Pfizer's decision to execute a deal before the upcoming readout of Phase 3 clinical trial data for Arena's etrasimod, an experimental ulcerative colitis treatment. That data is expected early next year. Pfizer's stock has gained 43.4% so far this year, while Arena's shares are down 35.0%. The S&amp;P 500

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Luxembourg's economy expanded by 0.9 percent quarter-over-quarter in the three months to September of 2021, following a revised flat reading in the previous period and marking the fifth quarter in a row without contracting. Growth was exclusively supported by consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households (2.0 percent vs 1.9 percent in Q2). However, the contribution from net foreign demand was less negative, as the gap between export growth (0.0 percent vs 1.1 percent) and import growth (0.2 percent vs 1.5 percent) shrank. On the other hand, negative growth rates were seen in public expenditure (-0.3 percent vs 1.6 percent) and gross fixed capital formation (-1.4 percent vs 2.7 percent). Year-on-year, GDP hiked 5.3 percent, slowing from an upwardly revised 12.6 percent hike in Q2. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Omicron impact on world oil demand to be 'mild and short-lived': OPEC - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday left its forecast for global oil demand unchanged, saying it expected the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to have little lasting impact. "The impact of the new omicron variant is expected to be mild and short-lived, as the world becomes better equipped to manage COVID-19 and its related challenges," OPEC said in its monthly report. OPEC still expects demand growth of 5.7 million barrels a day this year, reflecting a boost to first-half demand that was offset by a downward revision to third-quarter consumption due to a rise in COVID-19 cases and softer industrial production in China, as well as an easing recovery in transportation fuel consumption in India. Fourth-quarter 2021 oil demand was also adjusted slightly lower to account for COVID-19 containment measures and the potential impact of the omicron variant. For 2022, the forecast for demand growth was left unchanged at 4.2 million barrels a day, with some of the recovery previously penciled in for the current quarter shifted to the first quarter of next year, "followed by a more steady recovery" throughout the second half of 2022, the report said. ,  “Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki warned that markets could be headed for a crash and suggested that an economic depression could be brewing as well, in a recent tweet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Angola's annual inflation rate accelerated for the eighth straight month to 27% in November of 2021, from 26.9% in the previous month, its highest level since July of 2017. Food inflation remains above 30%, still reflecting the impact of the sharp devaluation of the kwanza last year amid the country's strong dependence on imported goods. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 2.1%, the same pace as in the prior month, mainly driven by prices of food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages (2.4%); alcoholic beverages &amp; tobacco (2.2%); clothing &amp; footwear (2.2%) and furnishings (2.2%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on Australian 10-year government bonds resumed its downward momentum to 1.60%, close to a two-month low of 1.58% hit on December 5th, amid a global rally in government bonds ahead of a series of interest rate decisions by major central banks, while omicron concerns filled the background. Last week, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate unchanged at a record low of 0.1%, citing inflationary pressures are softer than in other countries amid modest wages growth. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is expected to announce a faster unwinding of monetary stimulus programs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Half of UK families £110 a year worse off since 2019, report says </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Half of UK families have seen their disposable incomes shrink in the last two years, new analysis suggests.                                                                                                                                                                                     , A report by a left-of-centre think tank says that the poorest half of the population have had their incomes squeezed by £110 since 2019.                                                                                                                                                        , The New Economics Foundation (NEF) also says that the richest 5% are better off by £3,300 a year.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Incomes in regions such as London have risen six times faster than those in the north east.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , As a result, the think tank has called into question the success of the government's "levelling up" policy, which aims to improve standards of living and productivity in areas of the UK that have traditionally been "left behind".                                                           , The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: "In addition to the £4.8bn Levelling Up Fund, we're providing record investment in infrastructure worth over £96bn, £12bn in affordable housing and a £2.6bn Shared Prosperity Fund to help rebalance opportunity across the UK. , "We are widening access to new jobs - 56,000 just this year - and we're building on that through a £200m boost to communities to help build skills.                                                                                                                                             , "The forthcoming Levelling Up White Paper will set out how we will further improve opportunity and livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic."                                                                                                                             , In 2019, the pledge may have helped the Conservatives win votes in the so-called "red wall" region in the north of England that traditionally elected Labour MPs.                                                                                                                               , The NEF analysis found that in the two years since the election, the poorest 50% of the population in every region apart from London and the east of England saw their incomes squeezed by an average of £110 per year, after accounting for increases in the cost of living.                   , As a result, the gap in incomes across regions has widened, with areas along the "red wall" worst hit. Disposable incomes in the north east of England have risen by just £20 a year on average, or 0.1%.                                                                                       , In the south east of England, however, incomes have jumped by £550.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Single parents were the worst affected families across all regions. Those in Yorkshire and the Humber and the north west and Merseyside saw their incomes fall by around 15 times as much as those in London.                                                                                   , "With prices expected to continue increasing, the threat of a rise in interest rates and ongoing effects of Brexit, things could get a lot tougher for families that have already suffered most," said Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the NEF.                     , He added that more could be done to help families in the short term, such as introducing a minimum income floor which better reflects the true cost of living.                                                                                                                                  , Prices are already going up at a relatively rapid rate on a variety of items and services due to ongoing labour shortages, supply chain issues and extra red tape after Brexit.                                                                                                                 , At the time of the Budget in October, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate in 30 years.                                                                                                 , The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, have acknowledged that household budgets are strained.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures erased early gains to trade below $75 per barrel on Monday, following an 8% jump last week, amid renewed concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and its impact on fuel demand and the global economic recovery. The World Health Organization said there was some evidence that the new variant evades vaccine protection, while Oxford University also said vaccines showed to induce lower levels of protection against Omicron. Meanwhile, OPEC has raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022, but left its full-year growth prediction steady, saying Omicron would have a mild impact. Elsewhere, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expected OPEC+ to stick to its plans of gradually increasing supply by 400,000 bpd at its January meeting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN)Britain is facing a "tidal wave" of infections from the new Omicron coronavirus variant, ministers have warned, as they sound the alarm on rapid transmission rates in London and across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the country's first death of a person with the variant. He told reporters at a vaccination clinic: "I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that's something we need to set on one side and just recognize the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population."                                                                   , The United Kingdom increased its Covid-19 alert level on Sunday and is once again accelerating its rollout of booster jabs in an effort to respond to the new wave of cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Monday that the data on Omicron infections is unlike that of earlier variants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "It's spreading at a phenomenal rate, something that we've never seen before -- it's doubling every two to three days in infections," Javid told Sky News on Monday. He added that it was too soon to tell if cases of the new variant are milder.                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "That means we're facing a tidal wave of infection, we're once again in a race between the vaccine and the virus," he added, echoing language used by Johnson in a televised address on Sunday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , On Sunday, the Prime Minister set a new target of offering all adults a third shot by the end of December -- a month earlier than originally planned. He had previously cut the interval between second and third doses from six months to three. The British government has focused its Covid response around the vaccine program since last summer, and had resisted reimposing restrictions until the Omicron variant came to light., "I'm afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need," Johnson said, citing early data that showed the effectiveness of a two-dose regimen is diminished by the new variant, but that boosters still provide a good level of protection.                                                                                                                            , "No-one should be in any doubt: There is a tidal wave of Omicron coming," Johnson said. "But the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose -- a booster dose -- we can all bring our level of protection back up."                                                                                                                                                                                         , The UK has so far reported 3,137 cases of the Omicron variant, though the true number is likely to be higher. Javid said "about 10 people" are in hospital with the new variant. Overall, the country's seven-day rolling average of Covid-19 cases has surpassed 50,000 a day.                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Omicron was probably behind around 40% of infections in London, Javid said on Monday. But Johnson said that "tomorrow it'll be the majority of the cases," underlining how rapid the spread of the new strain has been in its first weeks in Britain.                                                                                                                                                                                  , New guidelines asking people to work from home came into force on Monday. The UK has also brought back its mask mandate for shops and public transport, and now requires proof of vaccination or a negative test for attendees of large events.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The recent flurry of new restrictions marks a sharp turn from the past few months, during which Johnson resisted Europe's turn towards long-term mitigation measures like vaccine passports and mask mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But the embattled Prime Minister has faced a significant rebellion from his own Conservative backbenchers over his move to reintroduce Covid rules, relying on support from the opposition Labour Party to pass them into law.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Johnson is also embroiled in a scandal over reports that Downing Street held a number of staff parties last winter when the rest of the UK was living under strict rules banning social mixing. He has been forced to deny he fast-tracked Covid rules in order to distract from his political woes.                                                                                                                                   , CNN's Robert Iddiols contributed reporting. </td>

The UK, together with the EU and the US, were reportedly mulling further economic sanctions against Moscow, mainly targeting its energy, banking, and defense sectors to deter an invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, output from one of the largest oil and gas fields in Europe, the Troll field off the coast of Norway, was halted upon suffering an unplanned outage, which was expected to cause a 13% drop in gas shipments from Norway. Finally, inventories continued to deplete amid, as Russia has maintained steady but insufficient gas flows to Europe. </td>

The TCMB is expected to cut its policy rate by 100bps to 14% on its meeting on Thursday, pressured by President Tayyip Erdogan, who controversially backed rate cuts to promote a new economic plan, prioritizing economic growth, production, exports, and credit. The central bank cut its policy rate by 400bps since September. Meanwhile, consumer inflation rose more than expected to 21.31% in November, well above the central bank’s mid-point target of 5%, while producer prices rose the most in 19 years.

South Africa's economic outlook for the fourth quarter remains weak due to several factors such as the return of intense load shedding, metalworkers strike action and the onset of the Omicron variant, which drove the imposition of travel bans by several countries and may force the government to introduce tougher restrictions ahead of the festive season. </td>

A study flagging the Omicron’s higher transmissibility and evasiveness was offset by news that booster shots provide a high level of protection. Markets have since scaled back bets on a potential hit to the global economy, pulling safe haven assets lower. Divergent monetary policies also weighed on the Japanese currency, as hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve contrasted with the Bank of Japan’s firm commitment to retain easy monetary policies to achieve its 2% price stability target.

Their meeting, and a shared lunch, went on two hours longer than the original time allotted.                                                                                                              , The event marks a symbolic historic change in the relations between the two countries, 15 months after they signed a normalization agreement at the White House.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Just a few years ago, Israelis were not even allowed to enter the UAE. Now the Prime Minister is being welcomed with an official honor guard at the airport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , According to WAM, the Emirates' state-run news agency, the two leaders discussed areas of "bilateral cooperation," such as "agriculture, food security, renewable energy, advanced technology, health and other vital sectors."                                                                                                                                                         , Bennett had earlier highlighted growing trade ties between his country and the UAE in an interview with WAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But there was no mention in the agency's write-up of the interview of tensions with Iran.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "The volume of mutual trade has expedited within a few months with limitless future opportunities to develop it. Israel, like the UAE, is a regional hub for trade. Our cooperation provides unprecedented economic opportunities not only for us, but for more countries, which is another element for enhancing stability and prosperity in this region," Bennett is quoted as saying.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Israeli leader mentioned cyber security, health, education and aviation as four areas where the two countries were enjoying fruitful trade and investment, WAM wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Although neither leader mentioned it by name, Iran is top of mind for both countries, a shared security concern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Israel's government sees Iran and its nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, and continues to declare that they are ready to take matters into their own hands to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. They see the Emiratis as an important strategic partner in the face of Iranian aggression.                                                                           , For the Emiratis, the relationship with their neighbor is more nuanced. Last week, a UAE top security official paid a visit to Tehran, meeting with new Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi, the first such visit by an Emirati official in five years.                                                                                                                                     , A spokesperson for Bennett declined to comment on Israeli media reports that the Prime Minister presented the crown prince with evidence of Iran deploying militias and UAV units, only saying "they discussed a wide variety of issues."                                                                                                                                               , </td>

At the same time, the US Federal Reserve is expected to announce it will accelerate tapering of its bond-buying programme. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of Omicron "tidal wave" and announced an acceleration of the country’s booster vaccination plan after the UK raised its Covid alert level due to a surge in cases. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian dollar fell below 0.712 against the US dollar on Monday, remaining vulnerable to Omicron variant-related headlines and expectations of further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the Aussie gained last week after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates unchanged, but analysts pointed out a subtle change in the central bank’s language where a reference to inflation sitting in the bank’s target by late 2023 was removed, suggesting it is giving itself room to move a little sooner. The RBA also signaled confidence in the economic recovery, noting that “household consumption is rebounding strongly and the outlook for business investment has improved.” The strong trajectory of the Australian economy is seen likely to provide a floor to the currency as fears around the new variant ease. </td>

Policymakers in the Euro Area are due to decide on the future of the bond-buying program, while the US central bank will probably speed up its tapering of bond purchases and signal earlier interest rate hikes. Elsewhere, concerns over Europe's slowing economic growth mounted as the region struggles with surging energy prices and new COVID restrictions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures extended gains to $4 per million British thermal units in the third week of December, underpinned by expectations of higher demand towards the end of the year, as the weather cools. Additionally, domestic stockpiles shrank more than expected in the first week of the month, as government readings showed a 59 bcf draw compared with market forecasts of 54 bcf. Since peaking at a 12-year high of $6.3 on October 5th, US natural gas futures have plunged more than 40% and diverged from the UK and the Dutch contracts, which continued to trade close to record highs. Any concerns about tightness in the US gas market have virtually disappeared following a so-far warm winter heating season, which has dampened domestic demand, while inventories had enough natural gas for the coming winter months. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S&amp;P Global Ratings has revised on December 10th, 2021 Turkey’s sovereign credit rating outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the debt grade at B+, citing rising external risks from extreme currency volatility and high inflation. The agency noted that the lira has weakened 30% against the dollar since late October, against the loosening of monetary policy over the past three months, amid high and rising inflation. In its opinion, further depreciation could pressure inflation in 2022 and may lead to a bigger deficit. S&amp;P warned that could cut ratings if the government's policies "further undermined the exchange rate of the lira and worsened the inflation outlook, heightening the risk of banking system distress". Moody's credit rating for Turkey was last set at B2 with negative outlook. Fitch's credit rating for Turkey was last reported at BB- with negative outlook.

The Kiwi has been in a downtrend since the start of November, hurt mainly by a series of hawkish signals from the US central bank. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meanwhile raised the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% in its last meeting, in line with expectations but fell short of market speculations for a more aggressive 50 bps hike that analysts believed would be more supportive of the currency.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Steel futures were around CNY 4,300 a tonne, well below all-time highs of CNY 6198 touched in May, amid weak demand from China due to a crisis in the property sector, lower construction, chip shortages and slower activity from other sectors due to frequent power shortages. Meanwhile, production in China remains subdued after policy enforcements on steel production cuts, although such reductions did little to support prices. Many stainless steel plants in China will reduce production for routine maintenance or saving costs in both December and January. The total stainless steel output is expected to drop by 97,000 mt in December and by 290,000 mt in January. Elsewhere, President Joe Biden's Infrastructure Bill includes funds to be spent over eight years for infrastructures such as bridges, ports and roads while the European steel industry’s low-carbon transformation will likely attract large automakers and electronic producers. </td>

The annual inflation rate stood at 6.8% in November, accelerating at its highest level since 1982. Meanwhile, the greenback remained vulnerable to Omicron-related news, as a potential hit to the global economy could cloud the outlook and delay stimulus and rate lift off. </td>

Ukraine has wanted to join the alliance since 2002, but Russia objected on grounds that such a move would be a direct threat to its borders., JPMorgan says China's economy will be more resilient in 2022 and picks stocks that could benefit                                                                                                                                                              , NYU's 'Dean of Valuation' explains why he's ready to buy Alibaba                                                                                                                                                                                              , Goldman Sachs upgrades 4 Asian stock markets for 2022 — and lists stocks to buy                                                                                                                                                                               , In June, NATO members vowed to address threats from China in addition to Russia.                                                                                                                                                                              , Since taking office in January, Biden has only met virtually with Xi once, in November.                                                                                                                                                                       , — CNBC's Abigail Ng contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Got a confidential news tip?

Fosun was even planning to start domestic trial production by the end of August.                                                                                                              , However, five months later there is still no word from Chinese officials on when -- or whether -- the vaccine will ever be approved, even as the newly emerged Omicron variant poses a fresh challenge to China's zero-Covid strategy -- and its less effective domestic vaccines.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Much remains unknown about the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which carries an unusually large amount of mutations that scientists worry could potentially make it more transmissible and less susceptible to existing vaccines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Preliminary lab studies show two doses of the BioNTech vaccine, which is produced by Pfizer outside of China, may not provide sufficient protection against infection with Omicron, but three doses are able to neutralize it, Pfizer/BioNTech said in a news release last week. Two doses may still provide protection against severe disease, it added.                                                                                                             , China has not released studies on how much its domestic vaccines protect against Omicron, though experts and state media have voiced confidence in curbing the new variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , More than 1.1 billion Chinese people -- or nearly 80% of the population -- have been fully inoculated, mostly with inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac. But their efficacy was found to be much lower than the mRNA shots, and studies suggest the immunity provided by the Chinese vaccines wanes rapidly.                                                                                                                                       , According to the World Health Organization, Sinovac's vaccine CoronaVac was just 51% effective at preventing symptomatic disease against the original variant, while Sinopharm was 79%. In comparison, the efficacy of mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were as high as 95%.                                                                                                                                                                    , And a Hong Kong study published in The Lancet in June found that health workers fully vaccinated with BioNTech's mRNA shot had about 10 times the amount of antibodies than those who received Sinovac's inactivated vaccine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The limited protection provided by Chinese vaccines is far from enough to satisfy China's ambitious goal of keeping Covid infection at zero within its borders. Over the past few months, authorities have resorted to increasingly stringent measures to curb local outbreaks -- often at great economic cost and disruption to daily lives.                                                                                                                         , But infections have continued to flare up. Last week, more than 130 cases were reported in eastern Zhejiang province, home to the country's key manufacturing and export hubs. And several local authorities across China have called for residents not to travel home for the Lunar Chinese New Year to reduce the spread of the virus.                                                                                                                              , To improve waning public immunity, Chinese authorities have started rolling out booster shots -- but again using the inactivated vaccines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Some studies have found that mRNA vaccines can generate better immune responses as booster shots. A recent British study, for instance, found that mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna provide the biggest boost to antibody levels when given 10-12 weeks after the second dose. Two separate studies from Israel published last week, meanwhile, showed booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine reduced infections tenfold and Covid deaths by 90%., It's not that Chinese officials are unaware of the advantage of using mRNA vaccines. Last month, Zeng Guang, a former chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, acknowledged that "real world data showed that using mRNA vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines as a booster dose for inactivated vaccines will achieve better results," citing data from countries such as Turkey, Thailand and Lebanon.                     , But still, Zeng insisted that using the same technology to deliver booster shots would be safer and more widely accepted by the public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , So why is the Chinese government reluctant to approve Western mRNA vaccines?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said politics appears to be the main consideration at play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , China had been a frontrunner in the global vaccine race for much of last year, developing multiple Covid shots using the old-fashioned approach of employing an inactivated whole virus to prompt the body to develop immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , It has also sent billions of doses abroad -- a campaign that provided vital access to vaccines in developing countries, while also serving to help Beijing promote soft power and project international influence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "When China developed its own vaccines, they used that to show the technological progress of China. And now if you switch to a foreign-made vaccine, it's tantamount to admitting that you're not as good as other countries in terms of technological capabilities," Huang said.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The Chinese government may also be keen to protect the interests of its domestic vaccine industry, according to Huang. "I'm sure they (existing vaccine makers) would be very resistant to introducing outsiders to this huge market," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , While Chinese regulators held off approval for the BioNTech vaccine, domestic companies were given the green light to forge ahead with developing their own mRNA vaccines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Last month, China's Ministry of Science and Technology approved trials for a domestically developed mRNA vaccine as a booster shot -- for adults who have been fully inoculated with inactivated vaccines. It has already conducted clinical trials in countries including Mexico and Indonesia, though the results have yet to be announced.                                                                                                                         , The vaccine, ARCoVax, was jointly developed by Walvax Biotechnology, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences -- a Chinese military research institute. Its production base in southwestern Yunnan province has the capacity to produce 200 million doses annually, according to state media reports, which touted China's success in having "grasped core mRNA vaccine technology."                                                    , Several other Chinese companies, including state-owned giant Sinopharm, are also developing mRNA vaccines, Huang said. Beijing will likely want to approve homegrown mRNA vaccines before greenlighting any foreign ones, he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But there are signs that Chinese experts are hoping for more cooperation with their Western counterparts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Over the weekend, Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese respiratory disease expert and government adviser, urged China to increase exchanges and cooperation in vaccine development with other countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "We need to learn about the good things in other countries, such as mRNA (vaccines)," Zhong said at a forum in the southern city of Guangzhou Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "They've spent years on the research and managed to develop the world's first mRNA (vaccine) in just a few months...We need to learn from their technology in this area," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The outlook for large non-manufacturing firms in Japan stood at 8 for the first quarter of 2022, higher than the previous quarter’s reading but fell short of market expectations for an increase to 10 as sentiment was dampened by higher costs and uncertainties around the Omicron variant. Analysts are warning that the emergence of the new variant clouds the outlook and may keep the economic recovery unstable next year. Outlook worsened the most among firms in the following industries: service for businesses (-13), goods rental &amp; leasing (-10), information services (-9), communications (-8) and real estate (-5). </td>
