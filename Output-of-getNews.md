   <td style="text-align:left;"> Japanese Shares Mixed amid Weak Global Cues </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Nikkei 225 Index fell 0.2% towards 28,580 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.2% to 1,983 on Tuesday, as Japanese stocks struggled for direction amid weak global cues. Investors stayed cautious amid economic risk from the Omicron variant as well as central bank efforts to rein in inflation, which drove travel-related and high valuation growth stocks in the US lower. Early market laggards include Lasertec (-2.6%), Mitsui High Tec (-1.2%), Hitachi (-1.8%), Fast Retailing (-1.2%), Japan Airlines (-2.7%) and Ana Holdings (-2.8%). Meanwhile, gains were seen from Flect Co (12.4%), Toyota Motor (1.6%), Tokio Marine (2.5%), Visional Inc (2.5%), Z Holdings (1.7%) and Chugai Pharmaceutical (1.2%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australia Business Confidence Eases </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The NAB business confidence index in Australia dropped sharply to 12 in November 2021 from a downwardly revised 20 in the prior month, as the post-lockdown impact was less pronounced. Still, the latest reading stayed well above the long-run average, with sentiment remaining high across states and industries. Meantime, business conditions improved further, also above the long term average, as employment jumped (11 vs 6 in October) while sales edged up (16 vs 15) and profitability was unchanged (at 8). Conditions strengthened noticeably in the retail and transport but weakened in construction. Capacity utilization continued its recovery, reaching 83.2%; forward orders remained elevated (14 vs 15; and capex strengthened. " These results indicate a strong recovery is underway,” said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster “Notwithstanding the possibility of new disruptions related to the Omicron, the economy is well placed to carry this momentum forward over coming months and into 2022.” </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Here are the 10 U.S.-listed Chinese stocks with the greatest American ownership — and Alibaba's not one of them </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , BEIJING — The U.S.-listed Chinese stocks with the greatest share of American ownership don't include many of the big names familiar to Wall Street, according to a Morgan Stanley report.                                                                                                                           , Rising political pressure from both Beijing and Washington means more Chinese companies may need to delist from the U.S. and move to Hong Kong.                                                                                                                                                                     , But most of the affected stocks have low levels of U.S. ownership, according to a Morgan Stanley report published Dec. 9. And even those with more American money don't include well-known names like Alibaba.                                                                                                      , Here's the list:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The top five names on the list by U.S. ownership include biotechnology companies BeiGene and Zai Lab, KFC-parent Yum China and dating app operator Hello Group. The fifth name, JOYY, is a livestreaming company formerly known as YY.                                                                              , The median share of U.S. ownership for the top 10 names is 43%, according to CNBC calculations of the Morgan Stanley data for stocks eligible for a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The median for the top 50 names is 27%.                                                                                         , That of Alibaba is a far lower 13.1%, while Chinese electric car start-up Nio has a slightly higher share at 20.4%, the report said.                                                                                                                                                                                , Chinese companies like Alibaba, Trip.com and Baidu have held secondary stock offerings in Hong Kong over the last few years. That means if the U.S.-listed shares are delisted, investors can swap them for ones in Hong Kong.                                                                                      , Other companies, like Nio and video streaming site iQiyi, are immediately eligible for launching a listing in Hong Kong, according to the Morgan Stanley report.                                                                                                                                                    , But the report showed that more than 40 U.S.-listed Chinese stocks won't be able to list in Hong Kong in the next two years since they don't meet the exchange's requirements for market value, profit and other metrics.                                                                                           , Here's the U.S. ownership of the few stocks with a market value greater than $1 billion that aren't eligible for a Hong Kong listing:                                                                                                                                                                               , In the last several months, the Chinese government has made it harder for local companies to list in the U.S. by requiring additional data security reviews.                                                                                                                                                        , Just days after its U.S. IPO in late June, Chinese ride-hailing app Didi had to suspend new user registrations for a government review. Earlier this month, the company said it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange and list in Hong Kong.                                                                , Morgan Stanley didn't include Didi in its report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Meanwhile, pressure on Chinese stocks is growing on the U.S. side. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission early this month finished the preliminary procedures necessary to begin a delisting process for Chinese stocks that don't allow a U.S. government audit of three-straight years of financial reports., However, the Morgan Stanley analysts don't expect forced delistings until at least 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Institutions or non-American investors will be affected more by such changes. U.S. retail investors only account for about 13% of U.S. trading volume in Chinese stocks listed there, the Morgan Stanley analysts estimated.                                                                                        , JPMorgan says China's economy will be more resilient in 2022 and picks stocks that could benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , NYU's 'Dean of Valuation' explains why he's ready to buy Alibaba                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Goldman Sachs upgrades 4 Asian stock markets for 2022 — and lists stocks to buy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australian Shares Fall as Consumer Stocks Drag </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4% towards 7,350 on Tuesday, dragged down by consumer-related stocks as easing COVID-19 curbs brought an end to the pandemic stockpiling that drove sales in the sector last year. Woolworths Group shares dropped 9.5% after it forecast lower first-half operating income from its local food business. Other decliners in the consumer sector include Coles Group (-4.8%), Wesfarmers (-2.4%) and Endeavour Group (-2.7%). Elsewhere, technology, energy and travel-related stocks tracked their Wall Street peers lower amid lingering concerns around the Omicron variant and expectations for further Federal Reserve tightening. Meanwhile, Virtus Health shares surged 30% after the IVF company received a A$607 million takeover offer from BGH Group. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Starbucks Workers Push to Unionize in Boston Area After N.Y. Win </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Starbucks Corp. employees are petitioning to unionize two Massachusetts coffee shops, just days after a landmark New York vote created the sole labor foothold among the chain’s thousands of corporate-run U.S. stores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In filings with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday, workers at locations in Boston and nearby Brookline requested votes on joining Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. The same union last week prevailed in initial vote-counting at one of three stores in the Buffalo region where it had petitioned in August for elections. The group fell short at a second, while the third result hinges on the outcome of voter-eligibility disputes. Workers United has also filed for votes at three other New York sites and one in Arizona. </td>

"This is where most of the tragic loss of life occurred," Amazon said.                         , But Clayton's sister Rachel told the BBC that she understood from the conversation between her brother and her parents that he and the other workers were not immediately told to shelter after the first warning siren sounded.                                                          , She posted an comment on Facebook calling for publicity around the firm's approach to health and safety.                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Everyone knows that all Amazon cares about is productivity," she wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , She said she didn't believe her brother would have died if the company "got them [the employees] to safety after the storm started to get bad and took it seriously".                                                                                                                     , "No-one would have been frantically getting to the shelter last minute and my brother wouldn't have had to help people get to the shelter and put his life at risk," she wrote.                                                                                                           , "I want them to answer for this, I want this to be a starting point of places taking the lives of their employees seriously and treating them as more than a number."                                                                                                                     , The deadly storms swept through six US states on Friday evening causing the deaths of almost 100 people and damaging homes and businesses over a 200 mile (322 km) area. In Mayfield, Kentucky eight deaths were confirmed at a candle factory.                                           , The National Weather Service said the storm had intensified rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse with winds peaking at 150 miles per hour (241 km-per-hour), ripping the roof off the football field-sized structure. The 11-inch (28-cm) thick concrete walls fell in on themselves., Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is trying to unionise Amazon workers in different parts of the US, said it was "inexcusable" that the company required people to work despite the tornado warning.                                 , On Monday, US Department of Labor said an investigation into the building collapse has been opened by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.                                                                                                                               , Rebecca Givan, associate professor at Rutgers University's School of Management and Labour Relations, said companies have a legal requirement to maintain a safe workplace but the penalties for violating it is very weak.                                                               , From an ethical standpoint, she said companies should "prioritise the health of their employees and if they need to communicate to customers that delivery will take a little longer, they should be willing to do that".                                                                 , Amazon doesn't employ many of these workers directly she added, using subcontractors instead, potentially allowing them to sidestep questions over whether those workers should have been called to work on Friday evening.                                                               , The firm's founder, Jeff Bezos, has also been criticised after posting pictures of astronauts who had just returned from a space tourism trip aboard his Blue Origin rocket.                                                                                                              , Later he tweeted: "The news from Edwardsville is tragic.

The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November's producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October's 0.6% increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Federal Reserve plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank's asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt," noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. "The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Despite Monday's decline for equities, the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick, believe there's upside ahead for equities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022," he wrote in a note to clients. "COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets," he added., Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US warns hundreds of millions of devices at risk from newly revealed software vulnerability - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington (CNN)Hundreds of millions of devices around the world could be exposed to a newly revealed software vulnerability, as a senior Biden administration cyber official warned executives from major US industries Monday that they need to take action to address "one of the most serious" flaws she has seen in her career.                                                                 , As major tech firms struggle to contain the fallout from the incident, US officials held a call with industry executives warning that hackers are actively exploiting the vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "This vulnerability is one of the most serious that I've seen in my entire career, if not the most serious," Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said on a phone call shared with CNN. Big financial firms and health care executives attended the phone briefing.                                                                             , "We expect the vulnerability to be widely exploited by sophisticated actors and we have limited time to take necessary steps in order to reduce the likelihood of damaging incidents," Easterly said.                                                                                                                                                                                                , CNN has reached out to CISA for comment on the call. CyberScoop, a technology news site, first reported on contents of the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It's the starkest warning yet from US officials about the software flaw since news broke late last week that hackers were using it to try to break into organizations' computer networks. It's also a test of new channels that federal officials have set up for working with industry executives after the widespread hacks exploiting SolarWinds and Microsoft software revealed in the last year., Experts told CNN it could take weeks to address the vulnerabilities and that suspected Chinese hackers are already attempting to exploit it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The vulnerability is in Java-based software known as "Log4j" that large organizations, including some of the world's biggest tech firms, use to log information their applications. Tech giants like Amazon Web Services and IBM have moved to address the bug in their products.                                                                                                                    , It offers a hacker a relatively easy way to access an organization's computer server. From there, an attacker could devise other ways to access systems on an organization's network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Apache Software Foundation, which manages the Log4j software, has released a security fix for organizations to apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Race against time to address flaw                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But attackers had more than a week's head start on exploiting the software flaw before it was publicly disclosed, according to cybersecurity firm Cloudflare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Organizations are now in a race against time to figure out if they have computers running the vulnerable software that were exposed to the internet. Cybersecurity executives across government and industry are working around the clock on the issue.                                                                                                                                              , "We're going to have to make sure we have a sustained effort to understand the risk of this code throughout US critical infrastructure," Jay Gazlay, another CISA official, said on the phone call.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Chinese-government linked hackers have already begun using the vulnerability, according to Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technology officer for cybersecurity firm Mandiant. Mandiant declined to elaborate on what organizations the hackers were targeting.                                                                                                                    , "Over time, everybody can arm the damn thing," Mandiant CEO Kevin Mandia told CNN, referring to the vulnerability. "That's the problem. And there'll probably be great hackers hiding in the noise of the not so great."                                                                                                                                                                             , The "noise" is a real problem. For cybersecurity professionals, Twitter has been a constant churn of both useful information and, in some cases, misinformation that has nothing to do with the vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                       , To address the issue, CISA said it would set up a public website with information on what software products were affected by the vulnerability, and the techniques that hackers were using to exploit it.                                                                                                                                                                                            , "This will be a multiweek process where new actors are exploiting the vulnerability," Eric Goldstein, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said on the phone call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The ubiquity of the software forced cybersecurity professionals around the country to spend the weekend checking if their systems are vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "For most of the information technology world, there was no weekend," Rick Holland, chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows, told CNN.

Kill the Bill. That prospect is looking better and better. You recall Friday two game-changing numbers that may well have dealt the Biden plan for big government socialism a one, two death punch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , First, the 6.9% consumer price index showed inflation is not 'transitory' and we sure don't need any more government spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Second, the CBO gave a realistic scoring of the Biden monstrosity by making new entitlement permanent over 10 years or more, rather than the phony gimmick of "sunsetting" after one year to hide the humongous cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Pelosi called the C-B-O price-out 'imaginary'.

Transformation doesn't mean one year out. It means permanent. And that's what CBO's new score captures.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Natural Gas Futures Fall on Warmer Weather Forecasts </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures traded lower around $3.8 per million British thermal units in the third week of December, after weather forecasts pointed to a milder than normal weather in the remaining days of 2021, suggesting a lower demand for heating. The fall in prices comes despite the jump in European gas prices. On the other hand, domestic stockpiles shrank more than expected in the first week of the month, and government readings showed a 59 bcf draw compared with market forecasts of 54 bcf. Since peaking at a 12-year high of $6.3 on October 5th, US natural gas futures have plunged more than 40% and diverged from the UK and the Dutch contracts, which continued to trade close to record highs. Any concerns about tightness in the US gas market have virtually disappeared following a so-far warm winter, which has dampened domestic demand, while storage has enough natural gas for the coming winter months. </td>

Doubts arose around the effectiveness of vaccines after both the WHO and Oxford University warned about lower levels of vaccine protection against the new variant. Meanwhile, OPEC has raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022, but left its full-year growth prediction steady, saying Omicron would have a mild impact. Elsewhere, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expected OPEC+ at its next meeting to stick to its existing policy of monthly oil output increases. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Morgan Stanley CEO says he was wrong on return-to-office push: 'Everybody's still finding their way' </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman walked back an edict that employees should be back at the office by now and issued a new forecast for how long companies would delay the return.                                                                                                                                                                                         , "I was wrong on this," he told CNBC's Wilfred Frost Monday on "Closing Bell." "I thought we would have been out of it past Labor Day and we're not."                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In June, Gorman told conference attendees that he would be "very disappointed" if his workers hadn't returned to Morgan Stanley buildings by Labor Day. Those plans, widely covered by the media, were derailed in part by the discovery of the omicron Covid variant. Companies from Lyft to Ford have had to delay and reassess return-to-office plans in recent weeks., "I think we'll still be in it through most of next year," Gorman said. "Everybody's still finding their way and then you get the omicron variant; who knows, we'll have pi, we'll have theta and epsilon, and we'll eventually run out letters of the alphabet. It's continuing to be an issue."                                                                         , Still, more than half of Morgan Stanley employees have been back at the firm's New York headquarters, home to the bank's trading operations, Gorman said. About 65% of vaccinated employees have returned to that building, and 95% of employees have gotten the jab, he said.                                                                                           , Got a confidential news tip?

Energy stocks dropped by 2.9%, industrials shed 1.4%, and the healthcare sector slipped 1.3% with the latter reflecting poor performances by cannabis companies. On the other hand, mining stocks edged higher amid slightly higher gold prices. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada has agreed with the Canadian government to keep the inflation target unchanged at 2%, as expected, adding it could leave interest rates lower if needed to support employment. </td>

Meanwhile, investors worldwide brace for the last monetary policy meetings of the year from major central banks at which policymakers must define whether stimulus measures will be maintained or not, while also monitoring the advance of the Omicron variant. Locally, traders also keep an eye on any developments around the PEC of Precatorios. Meanwhile, Brazil's central bank financial markets' weekly survey showed growth projections were cut again to 4.65% from 4.71% for 2021 and to 0.50% from 0.51% for 2022, while inflation forecasts were revised lower to 10.05% from 10.18% for 2021, after 35 consecutive weeks of increases; and were kept unchanged at 5.02% for 2022. </td>

The Fed is expected to speed up tapering and traders will be looking for any clues for an earlier interest rate hike in 2022. Travel-related stocks were among the biggest losers with American Airlines, United Airlines, and Carnival Corp declining around 5%. Also, Tesla was down 5%.

Alexander Kueng also were charged in connection with their alleged failure to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, according to the federal indictment. Chauvin, Thao, Kueng and Thomas Lane also face a charge for allegedly failing to give Floyd medical aid.                                                                                  , Thao, Kueng and Lane pleaded not guilty to the charges in September.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The indictment said "the defendants saw George Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care, and willfully failed to aid Floyd, thereby acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd."                                                                                                                                                                , In April, Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for killing Floyd's death. He was sentenced to 22 and half years in state prison. Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will have to serve two-thirds of his sentence, or 15 years -- and he will be eligible for supervised release for the remaining seven and a half years., Separately, Thao, Kueng and Lane are charged in a state court with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. They have pleaded not guilty. That trial is currently set for March 2022.                                                                                                                                     , </td>

He also was sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , As part of a plea deal, he admitted to using his trusted medical position to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment for about two decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , At his sentencing in Michigan in 2018, more than 150 women -- including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney -- publicly told the court he sexually abused them. A number of the women said that they had reported the abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.                                                                                                                               , In addition, the Justice Department's inspector general released a scathing report in July saying that senior officials in the FBI Indianapolis Field Office failed to respond to the Nassar allegations with the utmost seriousness and urgency, made numerous and fundamental errors when they did respond and violated multiple FBI policies when undertaking their investigative activity.                                                                                                                                                                     , Settlement includes provision that a Nassar abuse survivor sit on USA Gymnastics' Board of Directors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The $380 million settlement also includes a provision to dedicate at least one seat on the USA Gymnastics Board of Directors to a survivor of Nassar's sexual abuse, according to court documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Additionally, at least one member of the organization's two committees dedicated to safe sports and athlete wellness will be reserved for a Nassar abuse survivor. A process to select individuals to fill these positions is still being worked on, but USA Gymnastics has committed to the provisions, the documents state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The nonmonetary terms of the settlement also include reforms to the organization's training and practices regarding athlete safety and proper reporting of misconduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, tweeted Monday that she is "proud of the nonmonetary reform commitments in particular" and said she is "eager to see these changes through."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "This chapter has closed, but the real work of restoration is just beginning," Denhollander said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Attorney for victims calls for further criminal prosecution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , John C.

The site is where the Communist-led Chinese government massacred an unknown number of pro-freedom protestors on June 4, 1989.                                                                                                                                                                         , The episode also references the iconic "Tank Man" photo taken on the day of the massacre, which shows an unidentified protestor standing alone before a line of Chinese tanks during the government's crackdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , BEIJING - JUNE 5, 1989: (JAPAN OUT) (VIDEO CAPTURE) A lone demonstrator stands down a column of tanks June 5, 1989 at the entrance to Tiananmen Square in Beijing. .

And geopolitical fallout," Manchin, D-W.Va., said, referencing Russia's buildup of troops on Ukraine's border.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , BIDEN PITCHES REVAMPED MILLIONAIRES TAX, GLOBAL MINIMUM TO FUND SPENDING BILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Manchin, a linchpin in the 50-50 Senate, has repeatedly declined to say whether he supports the latest iteration of Biden's "Build Back Better" bill and has maintained that he wants to see the text before determining whether he supports the measure or not. Still, he sounded skeptical about Democrats' Christmas deadline, which would give the Senate just two weeks to pass a massive piece of legislation.                                                    , Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., speaks to the Economic Club, Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2021, in Washington.  (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin / AP Newsroom)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "I know people have been in a hurry for a long time to do something, but basically I think we're seeing things unfold that allows us to prepare better," Manchin said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , His comments come on the heels of a new Labor Department report that revealed consumer prices surged by 6.8% in November from the previous year, the fastest pace since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1%. The CPI – which measures a bevy of goods ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents – jumped 0.8% in the one-month period from October.                                                                                                   , While Democrats have brought down the price tag of the social spending bill to $1.7 trillion from $3.5 trillion, Manchin has his party of using so-called "budget gimmicks" to conceal the true cost of the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office, at the request of Republicans, released a new analysis of the bill on Friday that assumes the programs are made are permanent, and found the legislation would add $3 trillion to the federal budget deficit. , Democrats have made it clear that by taking an across-the-board cuts approach to the spending package, they intend to force a future Congress to extend popular programs in a few years. Whether they will be able to do so ultimately depends on the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential election.                                                                                                                                                                     , Manchin called the newest CBO analysis "very sobering."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Sen.

But if the measures did not expire in a few years' time, the bill would actually cost about $4.9 trillion, according to the CBO.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The $1.7 trillion Build Back Better bill passed by House Democrats last month would establish universal preschool, expand Medicaid, provide new funding for child care and offer green energy tax credits, though it notably omits progressive priorities like free community college and Medicare coverage of dental and vision. It relies on $1.95 trillion in new taxes, including a 15% corporate minimum and a surcharge aimed at ultramillionaires.               , Because Senate Democrats are using a procedural tool known as budget reconciliation to pass the package without any Republican support, the party cannot afford to lose a single vote or they risk imperiling the bill's passage. </td>

The Russian President has expressed desire for an in-person meeting with US President Joe Biden -- but will the White House gamble on that?                                                                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The showdown is a test for the Biden administration, whose rushed withdrawal from Afghanistan led some to question Washington's stomach for wielding power abroad. Also undermining long-term influence is the possibility that Donald Trump, or another autocrat-friendly Republican will be back in power in 2025. The White House has however done an effective job corralling allies to multiply diplomatic pressure on Moscow after Biden's virtual summit with Putin last week.                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , G7 foreign ministers sent stark signals from their meeting in Liverpool at the weekend. "We've been clear that any incursion by Russia into Ukraine would have massive consequences for which there would be a severe cost," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, bolstering previous US statements. She added that democratic nations must wean themselves off Russian energy — a clear reference to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The diplomatic offensive is designed to force Putin to confront this question as he masses soldiers and material on the Ukraine border: Is the domestic propaganda value of another invasion worth a destabilizing economic backlash from the West?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A statement from the Russian embassy in London hitting back at the G7 reiterated previous Kremlin assurances that Russia has no intention of invading -- yet disconcertingly also appeared to rationalize doing so. "While Russia does not have a slightest intension to attack Ukraine, the situation in (the) Ukrainian civil war is indeed getting more explosive, with the irresponsible and unreserved military support some NATO countries and the UK in particular are giving to Kiev," the statement said. ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The West's chorus of threats could work. But it is risky, since the hostile rhetoric may make it more difficult for Putin to climb down without a tangible payoff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , There is another possible off-ramp from East-West tensions. Putin told the US President last week that he'd like to sit down together in person, according to a clip released Sunday by Russian state television. "We will definitely meet, I would really like that," Putin said. The disclosure came after it emerged that the US's top State Department official for Europe, Karen Donfried, will travel to Russia and Ukraine this week.                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Putin has, of course, used this tactic before, leveraging a massive troop deployment in the spring on Ukraine's border to get Biden to agree to meet him in Geneva. Another in-person summit would confer the global superpower recognition that Putin, who bemoaned the demise of the Soviet Union, craves for Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Asked about the potential for an in-person meeting during an interview with NBC News, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken dodged the question, saying last week's video conference between presidents was important "because as much as I can do with my counterpart, as much as other colleagues in the government can do with theirs, when it comes to Russia, President Putin is the one person that really counts."                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , And asked what it would take for Biden to agree to an in-person meeting, Blinken said only that the United States and partners in Europe were looking for signs of de-escalation and for Russia to "give Ukraine its border back."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Such ego-soothing treatment could offer the solution that Biden's been looking for. But without prior de-militarization at the border, Putin could also simply pocket the concession, then go ahead and invade anyway -- handing Biden a place among history's appeasers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , </td>

"Certainly that is something that we're looking to get done soon and hopefully before the president and everyone leaves for time with their families over the holidays," Psaki told reporters at a briefing. Biden has three more candidates to nominate, including a banking regulator, after announcing the re-nomination of Chairman Jerome Powell and elevating Lael Brainard to vice chair.     , The Biden administration thinks it can help "fast track" the uptake of electric vehicles in the U.S. by building 500,000 charging stations across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Robert Schroeder is the Washington bureau chief for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Harry Dunn: US citizen Anne Sacoolas to face UK court over death of teen, say UK officials - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Anne Sacoolas, the US woman accused of killing a British teenager while driving on the wrong side of the road in England, is expected to face criminal proceedings in the UK early next year, the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The 44-year-old is charged with causing 19-year-old Briton Harry Dunn's death in August 2019 by dangerous driving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "The case will be heard at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 18 January," the CPS said. "Anne Sacoolas has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice any proceedings."                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "While the challenges and complexity of this case are well known, we remain committed to securing justice in this matter," it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Previous attempts to resolve the incident in court have foundered, with the United States refusing to extradite Sacoolas to the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Despite the CPS announcement, a spokesperson for Arnold and Porter, the law firm representing Sacoolas, told CNN there is currently no agreement to have their client appear in a hearing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "While we have always been willing to discuss a virtual hearing, there is no agreement at this time," a spokesperson for Arnold and Porter told CNN by text message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , CNN has reached out to Sacoolas' representatives for clarification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Dunn family reacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Sacoolas has previously admitted driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the crash. After the deadly collision outside RAF Croughton, a US military base in England where her husband worked as a diplomat, Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and returned to the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The incident sparked ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries, with the US State Department in January 2020 rejecting an extradition request to return her to the UK for prosecution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In June, then-British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said UK prosecutors could seek a "virtual trial" of Sacoolas. "The US has not agreed to the extradition, but the path is clear for the legal authorities in the UK to approach Anne Sacoolas's lawyers -- without any problem from the US government -- to see whether some kind of virtual trial or process could allow some accountability and some solace and some justice for the Dunn family," he said in an interview with the BBC. , Dunn's parents also brought a civil lawsuit for damages against her in Virginia, where she lives with her husband, having reached a "resolution" in September.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On Monday, they said they welcomed the prospect of a court hearing in their son's case, with his mother saying it had left them feeling "very emotional."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "It's been an exhausting and frustrating time since Harry's death but my family and I are feeling very emotional and overwhelmed having just the learned the news that Mrs. Sacoolas is now to face our justice system," Charlotte Charles said in a statement on Monday. "It is all that we asked for following Harry's death."                                                                                                                                                               , Dunn's father, Tim Dunn, said however that he still couldn't forgive the US government for allowing Sacoolas to retain diplomatic immunity. "I wish our Government could have done more to stop this injustice and it should not have been down to us to have to fight as hard as we have had to," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                    , US State Department principal deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said she didn't "have anything new to announce" when asked about the development in the UK during a State Department briefing Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , 'National security' considerations around Sacoolas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Since the 2019 incident, Sacoolas has been described as "the wife of an American diplomat."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , However, the US civil proceedings have prompted questions over her employment in England, whether she was working for the State Department when the accident occurred, and if her work was relevant to the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In an unexpected move in July, lawyers for the US government tried to suppress details surrounding Sacoolas' employment citing "national security." It was the first time the US government admitted publicly that Anne Sacoolas, and not just her husband, "were employees of the United States Government at the time" of the crash.                                                                                                                                                         , When the crash occurred in 2019 Jonathan Sacoolas was known as an intelligence officer stationed as "administrative and technical staff" at RAF Croughton, a military base used as an intelligence-gathering hub by the CIA and NSA. But Anne Sacoolas "was notified to the UK Government by the US as a spouse with no official role," Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told reporters in February 2021.                                                                     , The US government argues that the details of who Sacoolas was working for in England wasn't important to the civil case because "information concerning the United States Government has little to no relevance to an adjudication of any remaining issues in this case."                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , But it could be significant as the US and UK agreed in the mid-1990s that American intelligence officers posted to RAF Croughton would not be able to claim diplomatic immunity for any criminal incidents that occur outside the US base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , If it had been revealed in the weeks after Dunn's death that Anne Sacoolas was employed by the US government in intelligence work, she may not as easily have been able to assert the diplomatic immunity of a spouse and leave the country, the Dunn family believes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , CNN's Jonny Hallam, Jennifer Hansler and Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NatWest fined £265m after bin bags of cash laundered </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NatWest has been fined £265m after admitting it failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly £400m by one firm.                                                                                                                                                                     , A gold trading business suspected of money-laundering deposited £700,000 in cash into one NatWest branch in black bin bags, a court heard on Monday.                                                                                                                                , A criminal gang deposited huge sums of cash across about 50 branches, prosecutors for the UK's financial watchdog said.                                                                                                                                                             , NatWest said it deeply regrets failing to monitor the customer properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , It is the first time a financial institution has faced criminal prosecution by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under anti-money laundering laws in the UK.                                                                                                                    , The fine would have been much higher, but it was reduced because the bank had pleaded guilty, the judge said at the sentencing hearing.                                                                                                                                             , NatWest, which is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, pleaded guilty to three offences under UK money-laundering regulations in October.                                                                                                                                      , The bank's chief executive Alison Rose said: "NatWest takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously.                                                                                                                                           , "We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money-laundering."                                                                                                                                  , She added that while the case had come to an end, the bank would continue to invest in fighting financial crime.                                                                                                                                                                    , Bradford jewellers Fowler Oldfield's predicted annual turnover when taken on as a client by NatWest was £15m. But it deposited about £365m over five years, including £264m in cash.                                                                                                , The company, which was shut down following a police raid in 2016, was initially marked as "high-risk", but that was downgraded in December 2013.                                                                                                                                    , The FCA's lawyer Clare Montgomery said there "was a rapid escalation in the amount of cash" being deposited from November 2013, with figures reaching up to £1.8m a day. By 2014, Fowler Oldfield was NatWest's "single most lucrative" client in the Bradford area.                , Southall received about £42m in cash between January 2015 and March 2016, for example, but no report was made that it was suspicious.                                                                                                                                               , That is despite lawyers saying earlier on Monday that one person in Walsall arrived at a branch with so much cash, packed in bin-liners, that they broke and the money had to be repacked.                                                                                          , Ms Montgomery added that the cash did not even fit in the branch's floor-to-ceiling safes.                                                                                                                                                                                          , NatWest did not properly look into numerous warnings generated by its systems, the FCA lawyer said earlier on Monday.                                                                                                                                                               , One rule designed to flag suspicious activity was disabled by the bank because it created too many alerts, "so the bank decided it should be deactivated", Ms Montgomery added, while NatWest also recorded cash deposits by Fowler Oldfield as cheques between 2008 and March 2017., The National Crime Agency also raised concerns at one point because of the high number of Scottish banknotes being deposited in England, the court heard.                                                                                                                           , And a NatWest cash centre in north-eastern England raised queries about Scottish banknotes, saying that they had a "musty smell", suggesting they might have been stored rather than in normal circulation.                                                                         , The state-backed bank was "in no way complicit in the money-laundering which took place", the judge said at Southwark Crown Court on Monday.                                                                                                                                        , But they added: "Without the bank's failings, the money could not have been laundered."                                                                                                                                                                                             , Sara George, partner at Sidley and a former prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told the BBC that it was clear there were failings at every level.                                                                                                                     , "It's hard to imagine a much more clear indication of criminal proceeds than black bin-liners of money.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Top Meta exec blames users for spreading misinformation - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Individual users, not tech platforms, shoulder the responsibility for the spread of misinformation online, according to Andrew Bosworth, a top exec at Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook.                                                                                                                                                                         , In an interview over the weekend with Axios on HBO, Bosworth said it is not up to Meta to stifle the views of individuals who wish to express themselves by sharing their beliefs.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The individual humans are the ones who choose to believe or not believe a thing; they're the ones that choose to share or not to share a thing," Bosworth told Axios's Ina Fried in a snippet of the interview.                                                                                                                                                                   , Pressed further on vaccine hesitancy and whether Meta may be contributing to it despite its efforts to provide authoritative information, Bosworth argued that in a democracy where people are free to speak their minds, people can choose to seek out whatever information they prefer.                                                                                          , "You have an issue with those people," said Bosworth, according to Axios. "You don't have an issue with Facebook. You can't put that on me."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The company has been accused by its critics of facilitating the spread of bogus health claims, climate change denialism and the lie that the 2020 election was stolen or illegitimate. Research has also shown that right-wing misinformation is far more engaging than misinformation from other sources.                                                                         , In some contexts, Meta has moved to promote reliable information in users' feeds. For example, the company has said it's connected more than 2 billion people to trustworthy Covid-19 information through its portal on the topic, and in 2020 it used labels to inform people about news organizations' projected election outcome.                                               , But as the Delta variant of the coronavirus began accelerating worldwide this year, critics including President Joe Biden pointed out that continued vaccine hesitancy, driven by misinformation on social media, was contributing to the virus's death toll.                                                                                                                      , In the Axios interview, Bosworth suggested that despite the accumulated knowledge of scientists, it is not possible for Meta to have enough of a grasp on what is factually true to be able to restrict user speech. "Our ability to know what is misinformation is itself in question, and I think reasonably so," he said.                                                       , Bosworth takes over as Meta's CTO next year. A longtime Facebook executive and a close confidant of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Bosworth has vocally defended the company's laser-like focus on growth as "justified" because its products connect people. He has also argued that the company's algorithms are merely "exposing the desires of humanity itself, for better or for worse.", </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden, Manchin to speak Monday afternoon on Build Back Better bill, White House says  - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> President Joe Biden will speak on Monday afternoon with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist West Virginia Democrat who hasn't endorsed Biden's roughly $2 trillion social-spending bill. "The president looks forward to speaking directly with Sen. Manchin about making the case for why the president feels this legislation should move forward," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Democrats are aiming to finish the Build Back Better bill by Christmas, though that timeline faces challenges amid Manchin's reservations about the legislation. The bill, which has passed the House, would need support of all 50 Democratic senators to pass in their chamber.      , The Biden administration thinks it can help "fast track" the uptake of electric vehicles in the U.S. by building 500,000 charging stations across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Robert Schroeder is the Washington bureau chief for MarketWatch.

The R1T is the first mass-produced electric truck in the U.S., and the recognition is highly sought by automakers globally every year.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI Crude Little Changed After Last Week's Strong Gain </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures were trading little changed below $72 per barrel on Monday after rising about 8% last week, as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant and its impact on global growth and fuel demand continued to weigh. Doubts arose about the effectiveness of vaccines after both the WHO and Oxford University warned about lower levels of vaccine protection against the new variant. Meanwhile, OPEC has raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022 saying Omicron would have a mild impact but left its full-year growth prediction steady. Elsewhere, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expected OPEC+ at its next meeting to stick to its existing policy of monthly oil output increases. Last week, the US Department of Energy said it would sell 18 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic petroleum reserve on December 17, as part of a previous plan to try to reduce gasoline prices. </td>

Shares of AMC fell 15.3%, pushing their monthly decline to over 31% and hitting their lowest level since June. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond dropped 6.5%.                                                                                                                                              , Other names that have been popular on Reddit's WallStreetBets chatroom also saw steep losses this month amid the overall risk-off sentiment and heightened volatility. Clover Health has plunged 14.5% in December.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Still, Monday's sell-off doesn't make a huge dent in the meme stocks' meteoric rallies this year. AMC shares are still up nearly 1,000% on the year, and GameStop has a rally of over 620% in 2021 under its belt. The rally has pushed GameStop to the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks from the small-cap Russell 2000.                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Earlier this year, a band of retail traders coordinated trades on social media and managed to create huge squeezes in a slew of heavily shorted stocks. The short interest in these names has come down drastically after the jaw-dropping episode.                                                                                                                                                          , AMC shares dipped 7% on Friday, after CEO Adam Aron and CFO Sean Goodman sold significant portions of the stock. Aron sold another $9.65 million in AMC stock as part of his estate planning, after selling 625,000 shares of the company for around $25 million in November. He continues to hold around 96,000 shares, excluding about 2.9 million issuable in the future and based on performance targets.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The year-end selling could also be a sign that investors are losing patience, as AMC's and GameStop's turnaround plans fell short for many. As GameStop tries to transform from a brick-and-mortar chain into more of an e-commerce retailer, it has tapped a slate of new leaders — including former Amazon executives Matthew Furlong and Mike Recupero as CEO and COO, respectively.                      , However, GameStop's new leaders have provided few details about their turnaround strategy and have yet to share an outlook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Manufacturing production in Uruguay rose by 6.9 percent year-on-year in October of 2021, following a 12.2 percent increase in the previous month, and easing for the seventh consecutive month as the low base effects due to the pandemic started to fade. The largest positive contribution came from the production of foods (7.5 percent and contribution of 3 p.p.), followed by the production of vehicles (123.2 percent and contribution of 1.5 p.p.), and oil refining (27.2 percent and contribution of 1.3 p.p.). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index closed 0.4% down at 71,430 on Monday, as investors turned more cautious ahead of the monetary policy decisions from the world's largest central banks amid elevated inflation and uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron virus variant on the global economy. Early in the session, gains were mainly supported by iron ore producers. Domestically, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is fully vaccinated, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, indicating the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, the government is making a renewed push for people to get vaccinated, but so far is avoiding new lockdown measures, in an effort to protect the economy. On the domestic data front, consumer price inflation, producer inflation and a leading business cycle indicator will be released later in the week. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stock markets closed flat to lower on Monday, with Frankfurt’s DAX ending near the flatline, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 shed 0.4%, and both Paris’ CAC 40 and Milan’s FTSE MIB closed 0.7% lower. Market sentiment was dominated by uncertainties about the omicron variant and caution ahead of several interest rate decisions from major central banks later this week, namely the US Fed, Bank of England, the ECB, among others. Besides changes to monetary policy, traders also await to see how the bloc’s central bank will shift from the current pandemic-era stimulus, or if the Fed will announce a faster tapering of its asset purchases. On the corporate side, UBS upgraded German software giant SAP (+2.6%) to a "buy" from "neutral", while Australian biopharma giant CSL confirmed it was in talks to buy Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma (+18.5%). On the economic data front, German wholesale prices rose an unprecedented 16.6% yoy in November. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil's 10-year government bond yield traded around 10.50% in mid-December, not far from a 3-1/2-month low of 10.265% hit on August 30th, tracking an international fall in yields as investors crowded into bonds while trying to assess what will be the impact of the new coronavirus variant on the economic recovery after some countries widened restrictions to curb its spread. Domestically, the Brazilian central bank increased the borrowing cost by 150 bps, as expected, despite the current technical recession, and also announced another rate hike of the same margin in its next meeting. The policymakers understand that it is time to move significantly into more restrictive territory, in order to consolidate the disinflation process and curb inflation expectations. Also, investors closely monitor any development around the PEC of Precatorios. The proposal was partially approved, with some amendments still needing to be voted again in the lower house. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB erased earlier gains to close 0.6% down at 26,551.02 on Monday, in line with its European peers, as investors traded cautiously while awaiting key monetary policy decisions this week, including further clarification from the ECB on how its regular asset purchases programme will adapt in April. On the corporate front, energy shares tracked lower oil prices to drop 1.3%, driven by Eni (-1.5%), and Saipem (-1.2%). At the same time, Unicredit declined 0.7% after its CEO Andrea Orcel stated the group could further look for acquisitions, both in Italy and abroad. Last week, the bank rose 15.7% after raising yearly profit forecasts by over 10%. </td>

The Bank of England will probably leave monetary policy unchanged, with officials weighing the imposition of tougher restrictions against COVID-19 in England and disappointing GDP data released on Friday, while the US Fed is seen announcing an accelerated tapering and signals for an earlier rate hike. </td>

       a provider of process software for the nutrition, health and industrial markets, said Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Lone Star Funds in an all-cash deal valued at about $3.8 billion.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, after which the company will be privately held.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PIMCO Managing Director and Head of Public Policy Libby Cantrill sits down for ‘Barron’s Big Interview’ to discuss the implications of Biden’s spending agenda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , President Biden has pledged to limit child care costs with the passage of his sprawling social spending and climate plan, but a new analysis suggests that millions of middle-class families could actually see their expenses double under the legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The study, published on Friday, was authored by Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago professor who previously served as chief economist of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Trump administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , BIDEN PITCHES REVAMPED MILLIONAIRES TAX, GLOBAL MINIMUM TO FUND SPENDING BILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , It shows that child care costs could increase by up to 102% – and as much as 122% – for some Americans under Biden's signature economic agenda, which would cap child care costs at no more than 7% of parents' income for those earning their state's median income. Parents are required to be working, searching for a job, in school or dealing with a health issue in order to qualify.                                                                                                                           , For a family with an infant and a 4-year-old, that could mean an additional annual expense of up to $27,000 unless they qualify for the subsidies in the Democrats' spending bill. About half of families using non-parental child care would fall into that category, according to the analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks about on the third plank of his Build Back Better economic recovery plan for working families, on July 21, 2020, in New Castle, Delaware.  (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "It is challenging to forecast how families would cope with such harmful and disruptive changes in childcare costs," Mulligan wrote. "Many families may respond by withdrawing a parent or relative from the workforce to provide the care."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The increase stems from the bill's increased regulation of the industry and the lack of incentives for providers to offer cheaper care, Mulligan said. Although the bill mandates higher wages for child care workers and also requires additional staffers per job in order to meet government-defined quality metrics, it only offers subsidies to certain low-income households (the program would eventually expand in 2025 to those earning up to 250% of their state's median income).                           , The median household income in the U.S. was $67,521 last year, according to the Census Bureau.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , There are other analyses that suggest Biden's bill could ultimately hurt the middle class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The left-leaning People's Policy Project estimated that families' costs could soar by an average of $13,000 if Biden's bill becomes law, largely due to mandated higher wages for child care workers. While the measure is intended to increase child care worker wages to the wages currently received by elementary school teachers, it does not offset the pay raise with subsidies for all parents.                                                                                                                , President Biden answers reporters' questions after delivering closing remarks for the White House's virtual Summit For Democracy in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Dec. 10, 2021, in Washington, D.C.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The current average cost of center-based infant care is $15,888 a year, with workers paid an annual $25,460. Biden's plan would raise workers' wages by 138%, to a new average of $60,660 a year. That could push the overall cost of child care centers to about $28,970.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , What's more, the plan subsidizes the price of child care by replacing flat user fees with an income-based co-payment. Costs that surpass a certain family's threshold will be paid for by the government – but if families earn just $1 more than the median income in the first year, they're stuck footing the entire bill.                                                                                                                                                                                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Under this scenario, there will be many dual-earning couples who cannot afford child care if both of them continue to work, but could afford child care if one of them quit their job and thereby brought their family income below the eligibility cutoff," the author of the study, Matt Bruenig, wrote. "Normally people who quit jobs to take care of their kids do so in order to save the money they’d have to spend on child care. Under this plan, they have to quit their job in order to afford child care." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Mexican peso traded just around 20.95 per USD in mid-December, not far from a 3-week high of 20.81 hit on November 19th, as investors took a breath ahead of central bank meetings. The Fed is expected to signal a faster tapering of its asset purchases and an earlier start to rate hikes as the economy stayed robust, with upbeat employment numbers and high inflation. Meanwhile, hotter-than-expected inflation data in Mexico put pressure on the Central Bank to keep its tightening cycle and raise again the rates by 25 bps in its next meeting as inflation is well above its 3% target. In November consumer prices rose 7.37% YoY, above market expectations of a 7.22% increase, and the highest in two decades. Also, Banxico is expected to outline a more hawkish policy stance to 2022 in order to curb inflation expectations and the contagion of this year's high inflation. </td>

Household spending growth expectations jumped up by 0.3 percentage points to 5.7%, a new series high with the largest increase reported for respondents with annual household incomes under $50,000. Home price growth expectations declined by 0.6 percentage points to 5.6%, the lowest since March, and expected earnings growth retreated by 0.2 percentage points to 2.8% from its series high in October. Meanwhile, medium-term three-year inflation expectations edged down to 4% from 4.2%, the first decline since June 2021, and only the second decline since October 2020 driven by respondents without a college degree. </td>

The US monetary authority is expected to signal a faster tapering of its asset purchases and an earlier start to rate hikes as the economy stayed robust, with upbeat employment numbers and high inflation. Meanwhile, in its last meeting, the BoC said that the new variant Omicron had raised the uncertainty around the economic recovery and maintained its guidance of start rates hike during the middle quarters of 2022, dashing some investors' expectations of a shift for a more hawkish policy stance. Also, the BoC decided to resume the reinvestment phase at roughly the same pace, during which it purchases government bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. Still, the policymakers noted that recent economic indicators suggested the economy had gained considerable momentum in Q4 namely in the labor and housing markets. </td>

It really isn't hurting families, and they're dead wrong. This bill does make it worse in a number of ways. Obviously, spending another $5 trillion heaping that fuel onto the inflation fire won't help, but really, it's the policies within it. They make the labor shortage worse in this bill, which will drive inflation. They do that by no longer requiring earnings or work in the child tax credit, and… they really exploded the subsidies in Obamacare, so much so that between the two policies, experts predict two million fewer workers will be available because of these policies. So here you are, shoveling more money into the economy with fewer workers and supply chain problems anyway, so that means inflation's going to go higher. It's obviously going to last longer. That's all bad. Joe Manchin knows this, and he also knows when the president calls him the president is nearly one million jobs short of his promises from the last COVID stimulus. So why would we believe the promises he makes on this bill? , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Rep.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index reversed early gains to trade slightly lower around 71,430 on Monday afternoon, as investors turned more cautious ahead of the monetary policy decisions from the world's largest central banks amid elevated inflation and uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron virus variant on the global economy. Early in the session, gains were mainly supported by iron ore producers. Domestically, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is fully vaccinated, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, indicating the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant. The national coronavirus command council is expected to map out the way forward this week following the surge in cases in the economic heartland of Gauteng in particular. On the data front, November consumer price inflation and producer price data will be released later in the week. </td>

But Americans said they expect gasoline and medical care to get cheaper over the next year, while they think that rent will remain unchanged.                                                                                                                , The report is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The survey plays a critical role in determining how Fed policymakers respond to the recent inflation spike. That's because actual inflation depends – at least in part – on what consumers think it will be. It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy – if everyone expects prices to rise by 3% in the year, that signals to businesses that they can increase prices by at least 3%. Workers, in turn, will want a 3% pay raise to offset the rising costs., "This is about well-anchored inflation expectations," Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said during a question-and-answer session at the Cleveland Fed two weeks ago. "Getting actual inflation down close to 2% is going to be an important part of keeping those expectations anchored."                                                                                                                                                                  , WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 22: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks as Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell listens during an announcement at the South Court Auditorium of Eisenhower Executive Office Building on November 22, 2021 in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                   , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has already signaled the U.S. central bank may speed up its withdrawal of pandemic support for the U.S. economy in order to combat inflation, which has been higher and longer-lasting than policymakers initially expected. That could mean the Fed's bond-buying program ends sooner than expected, potentially leading to a faster-than-expected interest rate hike.                                                          , "At this point, the economy is very strong, and inflationary pressures are high," Powell said two weeks ago while testifying on Capitol Hill. "It is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner."                                                                                                                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A Labor Department report last week revealed that the price of consumer goods rose by 6.8% in November from last year, the fastest pace since June 1982 – all but solidifying the Fed's plans to accelerate its tapering timeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "[The] consumer price data, with annual inflation reaching a near 40-year high of 6.8%, greatly increase the pressure on the Federal Reserve to wind down its asset purchase program even more quickly than previously communicated and bring interest rate hikes forward to the first half of 2022," said Matthew Sherwood, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Canadian 10-year government bond traded around 1.40%, hovering at a near 3-month low of 1.375% on September 24th, as investors crowded into bonds while trying to assess what will be the impact of the new coronavirus variant on the economic recovery after some countries widened restrictions to curb its spread. Also, in its last meeting, the BoC said that the new variant Omicron had raised the uncertainty around the economic recovery and maintained its guidance of start rates hike during the middle quarters of 2022, dashing some investors' expectations of a shift for a more hawkish policy stance. Meanwhile, the central bank decided to resume the reinvestment phase at roughly the same pace, during which it purchases government bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. Still, the policymakers noted that recent economic indicators suggested the economy had gained considerable momentum in Q4 namely in the labor and housing markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lithium carbonate prices in China rallied further to 222,500 yuan per tonne, amid higher demand and fears of supply shortages. Bets on long-term scarcity of the light metal set electric battery manufacturers to race against each other to secure lithium supplies through long-term contracts, as supply-chain bottlenecks and environmental opposition limit lithium production. Meanwhile, demand for electric vehicles continues to grow. China, the world’s top lithium-ion battery importer, is expected to double last year’s electric vehicle deliveries to 3 million units in 2021. Citigroup analysts believe lithium demand shall outpace supply until 2025. Elsewhere, Chilean presidential election frontrunner Gabriel Boric expressed plans on forming a state-owned lithium miner to manage and extract the country’s “lithium triangle”, the largest reserve of the metal in the world. </td>

The Fed is expected to speed up tapering and traders will be looking for any clues for an earlier interest rate hike in 2022. Consumer discretionary and energy were the worst-performing sectors, falling by nearly 2% each.

This is "nearly identical" to what consumers reported in 2018, according to Monmouth.                                                                                                                   , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , According to the poll, 36% of Americans found that this holiday season is more enjoyable compared to the rest of the year, down from 41% reported in 2018 and 44% in 2015.                                                                                                                                                                          , The Monmouth University poll was conducted by telephone from Dec. 2-6 with responses collected from more than 800 adults in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkish lira slumps further to new record low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Turkish lira has fallen to a new record low amid fears that the central bank will make a further cut in interest rates later this week.                                                       , At one point, it was down nearly 7% at just under 15 to the dollar, but it recovered slightly after the bank intervened in the market to prop it up.                                              , The currency is now worth about half its value at the beginning of the year.                                                                                                                      , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pushed the central bank to keep cutting rates despite surging inflation.                                                                                       , Economists surveyed by Reuters expect the Turkish central bank to reduce its main interest rate from 15% to 14% on Thursday. It would be the fourth such cut in as many months.                   , The president and his allies argue that lower interest rates will boost Turkish exports, investment and jobs. But many economists say the rate cuts are reckless.                                 , Last month, the country's inflation rate hit 21.7%.                                                                                                                                               , The  BBC's Victoria Craig in Istanbul says taxi drivers, food sellers and hotel patrons have all expressed surprise and anger as they see the value of the money in their pockets drop by the day., Normally, central banks raise rates to combat rising prices, but Mr Erdogan has called such tools "the mother and father of all evil".                                                            , Although the bank has attempted to bolster the value of the lira by using its dollar reserves to buy the currency, analysts say it does not have enough firepower to stop the slide.              , "We doubt that either intervention or a balanced current account will be effective in stabilising the currency," said investment bank Morgan Stanley in a note.                                   , It added that the central bank's relatively thin reserves meant interventions could turn out to be counter-productive.                                                                            , What cases will the detective duo take on this time?                                                                                                                                              , Prof. Steven Pinker tries to make sense of the situation...                                                                                                                                       , © 2021 BBC.

A vice president, written off as a viable successor. The risk is that something happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Economic risk: staring us in the face: inflation rages. The Federal Reserve has to deal with it. The risk is a recession and a big market sell-off.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , THE OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS: AMERICAN FARMERS CAN'T SHIP FOOD ABROAD BECAUSE FOREIGN SHIPPERS WON'T TAKE IT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Cultural risk: we are divided.

The holidays are upon us, and we should be turning our thoughts to friends, family church and temple. Instead, we're being hustled back into our masks, fired if we don't get the jab, attacked on the streets of our big cities. We're even supposed to check the vaccination status of our holiday guests., So for Christmas, I’m going to Florida. I want to be in a more positive environment. I can't escape all risk, but I can be in a place that lets me choose how I want to live. I'm tired of being down frankly.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Putin rues Soviet collapse, says he moonlit as a taxi driver to survive economic crisis - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago as the demise of what he called "historical Russia," and said the economic crisis that followed was so bad he was forced to moonlight as a taxi driver.                                                                                , Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on Ukraine, a notion the Kremlin has dismissed as fear-mongering.                                          , "It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union," Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called "Russia. New History," the RIA state news agency reported.                                                                                                , "We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost," said Putin, saying 25 million Russian people in newly independent countries suddenly found themselves cut off from Russia, part of what he called "a major humanitarian tragedy."                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation.                                                                                                                                                            , "Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place," the president said.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power.                                                         , Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used a lengthy article published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbor and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kiev as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history., The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January. The Group of Seven wealthy democracies warned Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine.                                                                      , The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories.                                                                                                                         , Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has backed separatists who took control of a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year and who continue to fight Ukrainian government forces.                                                                                                                                                , </td>

On the other side, Turkey will cut one-week repo auction rate defying a need to tame surging consumer prices and a falling lira. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Luxembourg GDP Growth Picks Up in Q3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Luxembourg's economy expanded by 0.9 percent quarter-over-quarter in the three months to September of 2021, following a revised flat reading in the previous period and marking the fifth quarter in a row without contracting. Growth was exclusively supported by consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households (2.0 percent vs 1.9 percent in Q2). However, the contribution from net foreign demand was less negative, as the gap between export growth (0.0 percent vs 1.1 percent) and import growth (0.2 percent vs 1.5 percent) shrank. On the other hand, negative growth rates were seen in public expenditure (-0.3 percent vs 1.6 percent) and gross fixed capital formation (-1.4 percent vs 2.7 percent). Year-on-year, GDP hiked 5.3 percent, slowing from an upwardly revised 12.6 percent hike in Q2. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP eased to 0.94% in the third week of December, as investors remain cautious amid the spread of the Omicron variant and rising coronavirus cases across Europe, while awaiting major central bank meetings this week. Investors look forward to further clarification from the ECB on how its regular asset purchases programme will adapt in April. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to accelerate its tapering of asset purchases following a 39-year high inflation rate of 6.8% in November. Domestically, Fitch Ratings upgraded Italy’s sovereign credit rating earlier this month by a notch to BBB from BBB- with a stable outlook, its first upgrade in four years. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Angola's annual inflation rate accelerated for the eighth straight month to 27% in November of 2021, from 26.9% in the previous month, its highest level since July of 2017. Food inflation remains above 30%, still reflecting the impact of the sharp devaluation of the kwanza last year amid the country's strong dependence on imported goods. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 2.1%, the same pace as in the prior month, mainly driven by prices of food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages (2.4%); alcoholic beverages &amp; tobacco (2.2%); clothing &amp; footwear (2.2%) and furnishings (2.2%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Half of UK families have seen their disposable incomes shrink in the last two years, new analysis suggests.                                                                                                                                                                                     , A report by a left-of-centre think tank says that the poorest half of the population have had their incomes squeezed by £110 since 2019.                                                                                                                                                        , The New Economics Foundation (NEF) also says that the richest 5% are better off by £3,300 a year.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Incomes in regions such as London have risen six times faster than those in the north east.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , As a result, the think tank has called into question the success of the government's "levelling up" policy, which aims to improve standards of living and productivity in areas of the UK that have traditionally been "left behind".                                                           , The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: "In addition to the £4.8bn Levelling Up Fund, we're providing record investment in infrastructure worth over £96bn, £12bn in affordable housing and a £2.6bn Shared Prosperity Fund to help rebalance opportunity across the UK. , "We are widening access to new jobs - 56,000 just this year - and we're building on that through a £200m boost to communities to help build skills.                                                                                                                                             , "The forthcoming Levelling Up White Paper will set out how we will further improve opportunity and livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic."                                                                                                                             , In 2019, the pledge may have helped the Conservatives win votes in the so-called "red wall" region in the north of England that traditionally elected Labour MPs.                                                                                                                               , The NEF analysis found that in the two years since the election, the poorest 50% of the population in every region apart from London and the east of England saw their incomes squeezed by an average of £110 per year, after accounting for increases in the cost of living.                   , As a result, the gap in incomes across regions has widened, with areas along the "red wall" worst hit. Disposable incomes in the north east of England have risen by just £20 a year on average, or 0.1%.                                                                                       , In the south east of England, however, incomes have jumped by £550.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Single parents were the worst affected families across all regions. Those in Yorkshire and the Humber and the north west and Merseyside saw their incomes fall by around 15 times as much as those in London.                                                                                   , "With prices expected to continue increasing, the threat of a rise in interest rates and ongoing effects of Brexit, things could get a lot tougher for families that have already suffered most," said Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the NEF.                     , He added that more could be done to help families in the short term, such as introducing a minimum income floor which better reflects the true cost of living.                                                                                                                                  , Prices are already going up at a relatively rapid rate on a variety of items and services due to ongoing labour shortages, supply chain issues and extra red tape after Brexit.                                                                                                                 , At the time of the Budget in October, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate in 30 years.                                                                                                 , The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, have acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Mr Bailey has even apologised for the situation. "None of us want to see that happen," he said in November.                                         , Coming as it does as millions go back to working from home under the new measures, the New Economics Foundation's study is a timely reminder of what is now well-documented: that in the pandemic, inequality has worsened.                                                                     , Earlier studies, such as one from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have found that in full-blown lockdown most people whose incomes were in the bottom 10% were in sectors that had been forced to shut down such as hospitality.                                                              , By contrast, higher earners are more likely to be in white-collar jobs in London or the south east that you can do from home, bringing them a boost to their disposable incomes as they save money on commuting.                                                                                , In the current wave of the pandemic the anti-virus measures are milder, but with no furlough or self-employed support schemes the safety net is much weaker.                                                                                                                                    , So where businesses see a drop in revenues because, for example, fewer people are commuting than last month, they'll have to withstand the hit.                                                                                                                                                 , The longer the wave lasts, the more likely it is that they'll have to cut jobs, worsening inequality further.                                                                                                                                                                                   , What cases will the detective duo take on this time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Prof. Steven Pinker tries to make sense of the situation...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , © 2021 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent Crude Cuts Gains </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures erased early gains to trade below $75 per barrel on Monday, following an 8% jump last week, amid renewed concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and its impact on fuel demand and the global economic recovery. The World Health Organization said there was some evidence that the new variant evades vaccine protection, while Oxford University also said vaccines showed to induce lower levels of protection against Omicron. Meanwhile, OPEC has raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022, but left its full-year growth prediction steady, saying Omicron would have a mild impact. Elsewhere, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expected OPEC+ to stick to its plans of gradually increasing supply by 400,000 bpd at its January meeting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK battles Omicron 'tidal wave' with booster jabs as infections rise and first death from variant recorded - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN)Britain is facing a "tidal wave" of infections from the new Omicron coronavirus variant, ministers have warned, as they sound the alarm on rapid transmission rates in London and across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the country's first death of a person with the variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Monday that there were 4,713 confirmed cases of Omicron in the UK, adding that the current number of daily infections is estimated to be around 200,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "While Omicron represents over 20% of cases in England, we've already seen it rise to over 44% in London and we expect it to become the dominant Covid-19 variant in the capital in the next 48 hours," Javid told Parliament on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Earlier on Monday, he told Sky News: "It's spreading at a phenomenal rate, something that we've never seen before -- it's doubling every two to three days in infections." He added that it was too soon to tell if cases of the new variant are milder.                                                                                                                                                                               , The United Kingdom increased its Covid-19 alert level on Sunday and is once again accelerating its rollout of booster jabs in an effort to respond to the new wave of cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "That means we're facing a tidal wave of infection, we're once again in a race between the vaccine and the virus," Javid added, echoing language used by Johnson in a televised address on Sunday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , On Sunday, the Prime Minister set a new target of offering all adults a third shot by the end of December -- a month earlier than originally planned. He had previously cut the interval between second and third doses from six months to three. The British government has focused its Covid response around the vaccine program since last summer, and had resisted reimposing restrictions until the Omicron variant came to light., "I'm afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need," Johnson said, citing early data that showed the effectiveness of a two-dose regimen is diminished by the new variant, but that boosters still provide a good level of protection.                                                                                                                            , "No-one should be in any doubt: There is a tidal wave of Omicron coming," Johnson said. "But the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose -- a booster dose -- we can all bring our level of protection back up."                                                                                                                                                                                         , Javid said 10 people had been admitted to hospital with the new variant. The UK's Health Security Agency confirmed they were spread around the country and aged between 18 and 85, while the majority had received two vaccine doses.                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , New guidelines asking people to work from home came into force on Monday. The UK has also brought back its mask mandate for shops and public transport, and now requires proof of vaccination or a negative test for attendees of large events.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Javid said on Monday that in the future Britons will need to have had a third vaccine shot to qualify for a valid "Health Pass," which is needed to enter nightclubs and large venues. He did not go into detail about when that will become mandatory, but said it would be "once all adults have had a reasonable chance to get their booster jab."                                                                                  , The recent flurry of new restrictions marks a sharp turn from the past few months, during which Johnson resisted Europe's turn towards long-term mitigation measures like vaccine passports and mask mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But the embattled Prime Minister has faced a significant rebellion from his own Conservative backbenchers over his move to reintroduce Covid rules, relying on support from the opposition Labour Party to pass them into law.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Johnson is also embroiled in a scandal over reports that Downing Street held a number of staff parties last winter when the rest of the UK was living under strict rules banning social mixing. He has been forced to deny he fast-tracked Covid rules in order to distract from his political woes.                                                                                                                                   , CNN's Robert Iddiols and Vasco Cotovio contributed reporting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures edged lower towards $71 per barrel on Monday after rising about 8% last week, their first weekly gain in seven, as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant and its impact on global growth and fuel demand continued to weigh. Doubts arose around the effectiveness of vaccines after both the WHO and Oxford University warned about lower levels of vaccine protection against the new variant. Meanwhile, OPEC has raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022, but left its full-year growth prediction steady, saying Omicron would have a mild impact. Elsewhere, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expected OPEC+ at its next meeting to stick to its existing policy of monthly oil output increases. Last week, the US Department of Energy said it would sell 18 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic petroleum reserve on December 17, as part of a previous plan to try to reduce gasoline prices. </td>

Japanese policymakers are expected to leave rates unchanged due to sluggish inflation and growth rates but could possibly extend its emergency corporate funding programs. On the data front, Japan’s business confidence among large manufacturers remained near 3-year  but missed market expectations in the final quarter of 2021. </td>

The UK, together with the EU and the US, were reportedly mulling further economic sanctions against Moscow, mainly targeting its energy, banking, and defense sectors to deter an invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, output from one of the largest oil and gas fields in Europe, the Troll field off the coast of Norway, was halted upon suffering an unplanned outage, which was expected to cause a 13% drop in gas shipments from Norway.

The central bank cut its policy rate by 400bps since September. Meanwhile, consumer inflation rose more than expected to 21.31% in November, well above the central bank’s mid-point target of 5%, while producer prices rose the most in 19 years.

Meanwhile, recent domestic data for manufacturing, mining and retail sales continued to suggest an uneven recovery across sectors. South Africa's economic outlook for the fourth quarter remains weak due to several factors such as the return of intense load shedding, metalworkers strike action and the onset of the Omicron variant, which drove the imposition of travel bans by several countries and may force the government to introduce tougher restrictions ahead of the festive season. </td>

On-warrant LME inventories increased to 78,300 tons in certified warehouses, the highest levels in over two months, while the prospects of a faster unwinding of US Fed monetary stimulus and quickening infection rates of the omicron coronavirus strain added further downward pressure. Still, the upward momentum may resume as the largest copper mine in leading copper producer Peru, is expected to see operations remain halted throughout the third week of December, as wages negotiations have yet failed to reach consensus. Also, the demand in China, the top copper consumer may rebound as the government has recently pledged to implement prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policies to stabilize the economy and support growth to a reasonable range in 2022. </td>
